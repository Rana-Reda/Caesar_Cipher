# Caesar_Cipher
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Java Project on GitHub!

This project is aimed at providing a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Java. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher that works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE. The main class is CaesarCipher, which contains two static methods for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher.

To encrypt a message, call the encrypt method and pass in the message as a string and the shift amount as an integer. The method will return the encrypted message as a string.

To decrypt a message, call the decrypt method and pass in the encrypted message as a string and the shift amount as an integer. The method will return the decrypted message as a string.
